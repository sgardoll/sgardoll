# Stuart Gardoll 
### Growth Operator & Technical Builder 🚀

I build systems that acquire users, validate markets, and drive growth. My work sits at the intersection of rapid product development and measurable business outcomes. I don't just ship code; I ship solutions designed to scale.

Below is a curated look at my active architecture, heavily focused on AI integration, ecosystem acceleration, and rapid consumer validation.

## Strategic Pillars & Active Deployments

### 1. Platform Enablement & Ecosystem Tooling
*Building the infrastructure that reduces friction and accelerates time-to-market for other developers.*

| Project | Stack | Business Value |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **[Custom Code Connect for FlutterFlow](https://github.com/sgardoll/CustomCodeConnectForFlutterFlow)** | JavaScript | AI-powered code generation that directly eliminates developer friction in FlutterFlow. |
| **[FlutterFlow Gemma](https://github.com/sgardoll/flutterflow_gemma)** | Dart | Localized Gemma 3 model integration, reducing dependency on costly cloud LLM calls. |
| **[Groq FlutterFlow](https://github.com/sgardoll/groqFlutterFlow)** | Dart | Ultra-low latency AI model integration for real-time application responses. |
| **[Embedding Gemma FlutterFlow](https://github.com/sgardoll/embeddingGemmaFlutterFlow)** | Dart | Text-to-vector pipeline enabling cost-effective, on-device RAG architectures. |
| **[TRMNL Nightscout Plugin](https://github.com/sgardoll/TRMNL-Nightscout-Transport-Plugin)** | Liquid | Data transport plugin bridging critical health telemetry with dashboard UI. |

### 2. Voice & Autonomous Agents
*Developing specialized agents to automate high-friction workflows and scale operational efficiency.*

| Project | Stack | Business Value |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **[ElevenLabs Convo](https://github.com/sgardoll/elevenlabsconvo)** | Dart | Implementation of Conversational AI 2.0 to drive hands-free, high-retention user engagement. |
| **[ElevenLabs Presto Agent](https://github.com/sgardoll/Elevenlabs-Presto-Agent)** | JavaScript | Hardware-integrated AI agent for Pimoroni Presto, moving AI out of the browser and into physical utility. |
| **[Voice Scroll](https://github.com/sgardoll/voiceScroll)** | Dart | Voice-activated teleprompter tool designed for content creators and rapid video production. |

### 3. Rapid Market Validation & Consumer Apps
*Shipping minimum viable products to test acquisition channels, validate pain points, and measure retention.*

| Project | Stack | Business Value |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **[Quickara](https://github.com/sgardoll/quickara)** | Dart | AI-powered image layer extraction targeting workflow speed for designers. |
| **[Lexity](https://github.com/sgardoll/lexity)** | Dart | Mobile vocabulary expansion tool testing consumer retention loops in the ed-tech space. |
| **[Content Craft](https://github.com/sgardoll/ContentCraft)** | TypeScript | Workflow automation designed to drastically reduce overhead in AI content pipelines. |
| **[Image Dreamer](https://github.com/sgardoll/image_dreamer)** | TypeScript | Real-time voice-to-image generation testing latency boundaries in generative UX. |
| **[Let's Build Planner](https://github.com/sgardoll/letsBuildPlanner)** | Dart | Content creation calendar testing organizational utility for digital creators. |
| **[Alchermix](https://github.com/sgardoll/alchermix)** | HTML | Business idea mashup app built for rapid concept ideation and brainstorming. |

## The Growth Mindset
Code is a liability until it has users. My approach to engineering is heavily filtered through a growth lens:
1. **Validate First:** Build only what the market demands.
2. **Optimize the Funnel:** Every UI component must serve user acquisition, retention, or monetization.
3. **Ship and Measure:** Deploy rapidly, analyze the data, and ruthlessly cut what doesn't convert.

## Let's Talk Business
I am always looking to connect with founders, operators, and technical teams who treat development as a growth lever rather than a cost center.
